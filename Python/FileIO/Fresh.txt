Now, this is a story all about how,
my life got flip-turned upside down.
And Id like to take a minute just sit right there,
Ill tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air.

In west Philadelphia, born and raised,
on the playground is where I spent most of my days.
Chillin out maxin, relaxin all cool,
and all shootin some b-ball outside of the school.
When a couple of guys, who were up to no good, started makin trouble in my neighbourhood.
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared,
she said, Youre movin with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air.

I whistled for a cab and when it came near,
the license plate said Fresh and had dice in the mirror!
If anything, I could say that this cab was rare,
But I said, Naw forget it. Yo homes to Bel-Air!

I pulled up to a house about seven or eight,
and I yelled to the cabby, Yo homes, smell ya later!
Looked at my kingdom, I was finally there.
To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel-Air.
